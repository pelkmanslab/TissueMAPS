'''Jterator module for measuring intensity statistics.'''
import collections
import numpy as np

VERSION = '0.1.0'

Output = collections.namedtuple('Output', ['label_image'])


def main(input_image, plot=False):
    '''
    Takes in an `intensity_image` (i.e., a TissueMAPS input image) and
    re-uses it as a `label_image` (i.e., pixels belonging to the same
    object have the same unique non-zero integer value).

    Nothing is changed in the input image: it already needs to be a
    label image, e.g.  a label image created in cellprofiler and
    uploaded to TissueMaps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_image: numpy.ndarray[int32]
        intensity image that should be re-used as a label image
    plot: bool, optional
        whether a plot should be generated (default: ``False``)

    Returns
    -------
    jtmodules.label.Output[Union[numpy.ndarray, str]]
    '''
    return Output(input_image.astype(np.int32))
