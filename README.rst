Status of the testing pipeline: |pipeline|
If the badge appears as status "unknown" is because the pipeline started before
the git mirror was updated, which means that GitLab believes the pipeline ran
for the previous commit and not the new one. Click on the badge to check the

*TissueMAPS* is a software framework for distributed analysis and interactive visualization of large-scale, high-dimensional microscopy image datasets.

Online documentation is available at `docs.tissuemaps.org <http://docs.tissuemaps.org/>`_.


Quickstart
==========

*TissueMAPS* uses a distributed client-server model. The server exposes `RESTful web services <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_ and clients interact with the server via the `REST API <http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html>`_ using either the browser-based user interface or other client interfaces.

Server
------

The easiest way to set up your own server for development and testing is to use either the pre-build container images available on `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/u/tissuemaps/>`_ or the pre-build virtual machines images for `Amazon Web Services (AWS) <https://aws.amazon.com/>`_:

To run the containerized *TissueMAPS* server, clone the repository and bring up the containers using `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_::

    git clone https://github.com/tissuemaps/tissuemaps ~/tissuemaps
    cd ~/tissuemaps
    docker-compose up -d


To run a *TissueMAPS* server in a cloud virtual machine, launch a new instance from one of the shared `Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/sharing-amis.html>`_ using the `Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/>`_. To find the *TissueMAPS* images, filter public AMIs in the ``Frankfurt`` region for ``AMI Name: TissueMAPS server`` (see `AWS documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/usingsharedamis-finding.html>`_).

For further details and alternative installation options, please refer to the `installation guide <http://docs.tissuemaps.org/installation.html>`_ of the online documentation.


Client
------

Once you have access to a running server instance, you can interact with it via `HTTP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol>`_ protocol.

Browser
^^^^^^^

The easiest way is to interact with the server is via the web-based user interface. To this end, point your web browser to ``http://localhost:8002`` when running the server within a container. Otherwise, just point the browser to the public IP address of your cloud virtual machine.  This will redirect you to the login page. Once you have authenticated yourself using your credentials, you will see a list of your existing experiments.

cURL
^^^^

Alternatively, you could use `cURL <https://curl.haxx.se/>`_ to access resources via the command line:

Authenticate with your credentials:

.. code:: none

    curl --data '{"username": "devuser", "password": "123456"}' --header "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:8002/auth

List your existing experiments using the received `JSON web token <https://jwt.io/>`_ (replace ``XXX`` with the actual access token):

.. code:: none

    curl --header "Content-Type:application/json" --header "Authorization:JWT XXX" http://localhost:8002/api/experiments

TmClient
^^^^^^^^

*TissueMAPS* also provides a Python client that abstracts the *HTTP* interface and facilitas interaction with the server. You can install it via the `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ Python package manager:

.. code:: none

    pip install tmclient

List your existing experiments using the ``tm_client`` command line tool:

.. code:: none

    tm_client -H localhost -P 8002 -u devuser -p 123456 experiment ls


Or using the ``tmclient`` Python package:

.. code:: python

    from tmclient import TmClient

    client = TmClient(host='localhost', port=8002, username='devuser', password='123456')
    experiments = client.get_experiments()
    print(experiments)
